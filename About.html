<h3>This website is part of a 3rd year project carried out at the University of Manchester.
  The project focused on developing an Internet of Things smart parking device that would provide drivers around a city with real time information on a parking slot.
  This will inturn help reduce parking search times leading to a decrease in carbon related emissions and traffic congestion in the city.
  It is also hoped that drivers will experience savings in fuel costs related to long parking searches. Feel free to explore the website's features.</h3>
